    <h1>Geometry</h1>
    <p>
      Geometry is the branch of mathematics that deals with the properties and relationships of
      points, lines, angles, surfaces, and solids. It is the study of shapes and figures and how
      they interact with each other. Geometry is an important field of mathematics that has many
      practical applications in everyday life, such as in architecture, engineering, and art.
